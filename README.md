 This was a good exercise because it was all brand new to me. I'm still new to Python, so examining your example and trying to understand how it runs and what each line does has been helpful for me. After a couple of hours of attempting to figure out what was wrong without any code, we were burnt out. We tried different error handling methods, but we couldn't get it to run. Extreme Programming practices greatly aided our project development. Pair programming provided real-time code review and facilitated knowledge sharing, while Test-Driven Development ensured that our code works. However, coordinating schedules for pair programming was challenging. We tried to find a schedule to get it done early, but we were only able to meet during class hours on Thursdays.
